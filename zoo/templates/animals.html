                Our big cat exhibit showcases the majestic lions, tigers, and leopards that call Riget Zoo home. These powerful predators are an integral part of the animal kingdom. Each species has unique behaviours, from the territorial pride of lions to the solitary nature of tigers. The conservation of big cats is crucial, as many species are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.

                Our primate family includes playful chimpanzees, curious lemurs, and intelligent orangutans. These incredible creatures share many similarities with humans, making them both fascinating and relatable. Primates are social animals, living in tight-knit groups. Their intelligence is astounding, and many can use tools, solve problems, and communicate with one another in complex ways.

Birds are known for their ability to fly, but some species, like penguins, have adapted to life on the ground or in water. Many birds are migratory, traveling thousands of miles each year, while others have become experts at navigating their local habitats.
